<p> function parallel should accept the resistor values and output the voltage values
function potiential divider should  accept the voltage value and resistor values and print the  voltage drop acroos each resistor
function temperature check should check the patients temperature in degrees or celcius and output whether
they have normal body temp, are hyperthermic or hypothermic</p>

<p>These codes were written as apart of a lab </p>
